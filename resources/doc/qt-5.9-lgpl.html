distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it
is not allowed.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">This version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of
version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
additional permissions listed below.</p>
<h4 lang="en-GB" class="western"><a name="section0"></a>0. Additional
Definitions.</h4>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">As used herein, “this License”
refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
“GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">“<span lang="en-GB">The Library”
refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">An “Application” is any work that
makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not
otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class
defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">A “Combined Work” is a work
produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The
particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was
made is also called the “Linked Version”.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The “Minimal Corresponding Source”
for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined
Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work
that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not
on the Linked Version.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The “Corresponding Application
Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code
for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed
for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding
the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>
<h4 lang="en-GB" class="western"><a name="section1"></a>1. Exception
to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</h4>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">You may convey a covered work under
sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of
the GNU GPL.</p>
<h4 lang="en-GB" class="western"><a name="section2"></a>2. Conveying
Modified Versions.</h4>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">If you modify a copy of the Library,
and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data
to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than
as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may
convey a copy of the modified version:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">a)
	under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
	ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
	function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever
	part of its purpose remains meaningful, or 
	</p>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">b) under the GNU GPL, with none
	of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that
	copy. 
	</p>
</ul>
<h4 lang="en-GB" class="western"><a name="section3"></a>3. Object
Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</h4>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The object code form of an
Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part
of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your
choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small
macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in
length), you do both of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">a)
	Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
	Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
	by this License. 
	</p>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">b) Accompany the object code
	with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 
	</p>
</ul>
<h4 lang="en-GB" class="western"><a name="section4"></a>4. Combined
Works.</h4>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">You may convey a Combined Work under
terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not
restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the
Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such
modifications, if you also do each of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">a)
	Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
	Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
	by this License. 
	</p>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">b)
	Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
	license document. 
	</p>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">c)
	For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
	execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these
	notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of
	the GNU GPL and this license document. 
	</p>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">d) Do
	one of the following: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">0)
		Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
		License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable
		for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink
		the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to
		produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by
		section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">1)
		Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
		Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a
		copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system,
		and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the
		Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">e) Provide Installation
	Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide
	such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the
	extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
	modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or
	relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked
	Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must
	accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding
	Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the
	Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the
	GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 
	</p>
</ul>
<h4 lang="en-GB" class="western"><a name="section5"></a>5. Combined
Libraries.</h4>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">You may place library facilities that
are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library
together with other library facilities that are not Applications and
are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library
under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">a)
	Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
	the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed
	under the terms of this License. 
	</p>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">b) Give prominent notice with
	the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library,
	and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the
	same work. 
	</p>
</ul>
<h4 lang="en-GB" class="western"><a name="section6"></a>6. Revised
Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</h4>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The Free Software Foundation may
publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Each version is given a
distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a
version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may
choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">If the Library as you received it
specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU
Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for
you to choose that version for the Library.</p>
